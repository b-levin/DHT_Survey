To ensure the most effective collection of IoT-based evidence, it is vital for forensic practitioners to possess a contemporary understanding of the artefacts from different cloud services. In this paper, we seek to determine the data remnants from the use of BitTorrent Sync version 2.0. Findings from our research using mobile and computer devices running Windows 8.1, Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9.5, Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, iOS 7.1.2, and Android KitKat 4.4.4 suggested that artefacts relating to the installation, uninstallation, log-in, log-off, and file synchronisation could be recovered, which are potential sources of IoT forensics. We also present a forensically sound investigation methodology for BitTorrent Sync.}

abstract = "IEEE 802.11s introduces MAC-layer extensions to enable vendor-independent and inter-operable WLAN mesh networks. Featuring automatic device interconnection and routing, 802.11s networks provide a higher scalability, flexibility, and robustness compared to common centralized WLAN infrastructures. As logical Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks exhibit many of the characteristics of physical WLAN mesh networks on the application layer, it is obvious to consider solutions where both technologies interact to leverage robust distributed wireless applications, such as collaborative data distribution and synchronization in future smart cities. Envisioned scenarios include the administration and update deployment to specific device groups or the distributed caching and delivery of on-demand multi-media content to selected end points within a city-area wireless mesh network. Nevertheless, common P2P protocols, such as BitTorrent (BT), do not consider the structure of the physical underlay as they were primarily designed to be used over wired communication networks, such as large parts of the Internet. Hence, the default BT peer selection mechanism does not adapt to the network topology and varying medium utilization in wireless multi-hop networks. We present MeNTor, a set of optimizations to enable underlay-aware BT peer selection in WLAN mesh networks. It relies on cross-layer integration of default 802.11s information, only requiring minor extension of the BT application layer without introducing any MAC-layer modifications or traffic overhead. Our solution was evaluated in a 25-node real-world mesh test bed, using 10 different seed/leecher placements and comparing 18 parameter combination variants of MeNTor. Results show that average download times can be reduced by 30–40\%, depending on the seed/leecher placement and parameter combination variant. Finally, we recommend the variant that performed best across all scenarios as prospective default configuration."
